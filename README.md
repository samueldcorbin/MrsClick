# Mrs Click

_Have you ever tried to cast a spell, only to discover that you're somehow, suddenly targeting the wrong thing in the middle of a raid?_

You are not alone. Many WoW players suffer from missclicks. It's more common than you think.

_When you press right-click, you want to move, not to swap targets._

That's what left-click is for! Or maybe Tab! But never right-click!

_"I tried an addon to fix it, but then I had to double click or press another key just to loot or talk to NPCs!"_

Tired of missclicks? **Mrs Click is here to help!**

Mrs Click is a simple, extremely lightweight addon that prevents accidentally targeting things with right clicks, without interfering with normal right-click interactions.

By default, Mrs Click won't let you right click to auto-attack a new target so you don't accidentally swap targets when you don't mean to, but this can be configured if you prefer, allowing you to auto-attack normally while still preventing accidental right click retargeting of non-interactive units.

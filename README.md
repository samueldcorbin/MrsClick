# Mrs Click

_Did you just try to cast a spell, only to discover that you're somehow, suddenly targeting the wrong thing in the middle of a raid?_

Missclicks are a serious problem afflicting many otherwise healthy WoW players. It's more common than you think.

_When you press right-click, you want to move, not to swap targets._

That's what left-click is for! Or maybe Tab! But never right-click!

_"I tried an addon to fix it, but then I had to double click or press another key just to loot or talk to NPCs!"_

**Mrs Click is here to help!**

Mrs Click is a simple, extremely lightweight addon that prevents accidentally targeting things with right clicks, without interfering with normal right-click interactions.

Mrs Click has only one little rule: _If you want to use right-click to start autoattacking, you need to target the unit normally first (with left-click, Tab, etc.)._
